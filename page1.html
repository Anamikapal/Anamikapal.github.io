                <h2>App goal</h2>
                <p>Parent's app is a mobile application designed to improve <span>mental health of millennials & Gen Z</span>.</p>
                <p>The app solves the root cause of mental stress in young people as it is found through reserach that one of 
                   the biggest causes of stress in youngsters is job dissatisfaction & unemployment due to lacking interest in
                   the field they are working. This problem can be handled by <span>tracking the interests and progress 
                   of people,</span> starting right from their childhood by their parents.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='box'>
                <h2>Reason</h2>
                <p>Nowadays <span>Mental Health is in it's worst situation</span> & that's a big thing to worry about. 
                  <span>Gen Z (age 15-21)</span> and <span>millennials (age 25-38)</span> are the worst affected.
                  Their lack of concern for health, their social media addictions and lack of sleep worsens the situation.</p>
                <p> So this came out to be a topic of interest, and Design club of my college (ELEVEN) decided to work on 
                  MENTAL HEALTH to find some solutions that can be helpful to people.</p>

                      <p>As step one, we decided to know our own stories, to generalize what causes mental stress in a student's life.</p>

                        Then everyone in the group did some personal interviews with their friends and acquaintances who have gone through this problem.

                      <time>Internet Data</time>
                        We collected data from internet through blogs, articles, youtube videos, etc.

                        <p>Now every team member presented the data collected in square cut out strips (so that it's easy to read ) to be considered for further analysis.</p>

                        <p>In this activity everyone expressed mental health in the form of sketches. This was a fun activity to analyze the thoughts in eveyone's mind regarding the topic -</p> 
                        <p>Music</p>
                        <p>Loneliness</p>

                          <p>Then different statements were collaborated and put in different categories based on the connections between the statements. 
                            Connections are of two types - </p>
                          <p>Similarity between statements</p>

                          <br />

                          <p>Then every collaborartion was explained with a single phrase that totally describes the connection.</p>
